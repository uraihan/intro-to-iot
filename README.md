## Course content:

- Introduction to the IoT system
- Basic concepts of probability and random variables
- Definition of information and communication
- Introduction to networks and their different topologies
- The structure of awareness
- Basics of queuing theory
- Basics of game theory
- Three-layer model of IoT-based systems
- Problems with communication and information processing
- Applications in cloud-based services and system platforms

## After the course, you are able to:

- define information and communication
- differentiate the physical and symbolic realities
- work with the concept of structure of awareness
- characterise the internet of things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems
- model and analyse systems asconstituted by physical, information and decision-making layers

These skills are needed to built IoT systems for practical industrial applications.
